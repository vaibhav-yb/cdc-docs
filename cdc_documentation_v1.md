# CDC Documentation

### What is CDC?

  Change Data Capture (CDC) is a mechanism/tool to stream changes in a database, these changes can then be used by external applications in order to perform analytics or other operations. <br/>

 The core primitive of CDC is the ‘stream’. Streams can be enabled/disabled on databases. Every change to a watched database table is emitted as a record in a configurable format to a configurable sink. Streams scale to any YugabyteDB cluster independent of its size and are designed to impact production traffic as little as possible.

### Use cases

  Many applications benefit from capturing changes to items stored in a YugabyteDB table, at the point in time when such changes occur. The following are some example use cases:
  * **Sensors** in transportation vehicles and industrial equipment send data to a YugabyteDB table. Different applications monitor performance and send messaging alerts when a problem is detected, predict any potential defects by applying machine learning algorithms, and compress and archive data to low-cost storage.
  * **Analytics dashboards**: A popular mobile app modifies data in a YugabyteDB table, at the rate of thousands of updates per second. Another application captures and stores data about these updates, providing near-real-time usage metrics for the mobile app.
  * **CQRS model updates**: A financial application modifies stock market data in a YugabyteDB table. Different applications running in parallel track these changes in real time, compute value-at-risk, and automatically rebalance portfolios based on stock price movements.
  * A new customer adds data to a YugabyteDB table. This event invokes another application that sends a welcome email to the new customer.
Data replication: CDC can be used for data replication to multiple databases, data lakes, or data warehouses, to ensure each resource has the latest version of the data. 
  * **Auditing and compliance**: Facing today's strict data compliance requirements, and heavy penalties for noncompliance, it is essential to save a history of changes made to your data. 
  * **Cache invalidation**: CDC can be used for cache invalidation, to ensure outdated entries in a cache are replaced or removed in order to display the latest version of a web page.
  * **Full-text search**: CDC can be used to automatically keep a full-text search index in sync with the database.

### Process Architecture

### CDC Streams

  CDC Streams will be a user’s point of contact for fetching the changes from a database. Streams can be enabled or disabled. Every change to a database table (for which the data is being streamed) is emitted as a record to the stream, to be then propagated further ahead, in our case to Debezium and then ultimately to Kafka.

  #### DB Stream
  In order to facilitate the streaming of data, we have to create a DB Stream, this stream is created on the database level and can be used to access the data out of all the tables under a particular database.
  
### Consistency Semantics
  * #### Per-Tablet Ordered Delivery Guarantee
    All changes for a row (or rows in the same tablet) will be received in the order in which they happened. However, due to the distributed nature of the problem, there is no guarantee of the order across tablets.
  * #### At least Once Delivery
    Updates for rows will be streamed at least once. This can happen in the case of Kafka Connect Node failure. If the Kafka Connect Node pushes the records to Kafka and crashes before committing the offset, on the restart, it will again get the same set of records.
  * #### No Gaps in Change Stream
    Note that once you have received a change for a row for some timestamp t, you will not receive a previously unseen change for that row at a lower timestamp. Therefore, there is a guarantee at all times that receiving any change implies all older changes have been received for a row.

### Performance Impact

  The change records for CDC are read from the WAL. CDC module maintains checkpoint internally for each of the stream-id and garbage collects the WAL entries if those have been streamed to cdc clients. <br/>

  In case CDC is lagging or away for some time, the disk usage may grow and may cause YugabyteDB cluster instability. To avoid a scenario like this if a stream is inactive for a configured amount of time we garbage collect the WAL. This is configurable by a GFLAG.

### Prerequisites/Consideration

  * You should be using YugabyteDB version <version-number> or higher
  * You cannot stream data out of system tables
  * Yugabyte cluster should be up and running, for details see YugabyteDB Quick Start
  * There should be at least one primary key on the table you want to stream the changes from
  * You cannot create a stream on a table which doesn’t exist. For example, if you create a DB stream on the database and after that create a new table in that database, you won’t be able to stream data out of that table. A simple workaround is to create a new DB Stream ID and use it to stream data

### yb-admin commands for Change Data Capture

  * #### create_change_data_stream
    This command is used to create a stream ID for a given namespace. After executing this, you will get a CDC Stream ID as the response. For example, to create a stream on a namespace “demo”, use the following:
    ```bash
    $ ./yb-admin create_change_data_stream ysql.yugabyte
    CDC Stream ID: d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3
    ```
  
  * #### list_change_data_stream
    This command lists all the stream IDs present in the Yugabyte cluster pertaining to Change Data Capture.
    ```bash
    # No tables exist in the namespace in this case
    $ ./yb-admin list_change_data_streams
    CDC Streams:
    streams {
      stream_id: "d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3"
      options {
        key: "id_type"
        value: "NAMESPACEID"
      }
      options {
        key: "checkpoint_type"
        value: "EXPLICIT"
      }
      options {
        key: "source_type"
        value: "CDCSDK"
      }
      options {
        key: "record_format"
        value: "PROTO"
      }
      options {
        key: "record_type"
        value: "CHANGE"
      }
      options {
        key: "state"
        value: "ACTIVE"
      }
    }

    # if there are any tables in the database which are valid for CDC (tables
    # having a primary key), the table IDs for them will be there too
    CDC Streams:
    streams {
      stream_id: "d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3"
      table_id: "000033e1000030008000000000004000"
      options {
        key: "id_type"
        value: "NAMESPACEID"
      }
      options {
        key: "checkpoint_type"
        value: "EXPLICIT"
      }
      options {
        key: "source_type"
        value: "CDCSDK"
      }
      options {
        key: "record_format"
        value: "PROTO"
      }
      options {
        key: "record_type"
        value: "CHANGE"
      }
      options {
        key: "state"
        value: "ACTIVE"
      }
    }
    ```
  * #### get_change_data_stream_info
    This command is used to list the information related to the DB stream ID you are passing. It will list the namespace ID and the table IDs associated with a DB stream ID.
    ```bash
    $ ./yb-admin get_change_data_stream_info d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3
    CDC DB Stream Info:
    table_info {
      stream_id: "d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3"
      table_id: "000033e1000030008000000000004000"
    }
    namespace_id: "000033e1000030008000000000000000"

    # If no tables exist in the namespace, you’d still get the info, but there # will be no table_ids in the response:
    CDC DB Stream Info:
    namespace_id: "000033e1000030008000000000000000"
    ```
  
  * #### delete_change_data_stream
    This command is used to delete a DB Stream ID.
    ```bash
    $ ./yb-admin delete_change_data_stream d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3
    Successfully deleted CDC DB Stream ID: d540f5e4890c4d3b812933cbfd703ed3
    ```

### DDL commands support

  Change Data Capture supports the schema changes (eg. adding a default value to column, adding a new column, adding constraints to column, etc) for a table as well. When a DDL command is issued, the schema is altered and a DDL record will be emitted with the new schema values, after that further records will come in format of the new schema only.

### Snapshot support

  Initially, if we create a stream for a particular table which already contains some records, the stream would take the snapshot of the table and stream all the data that resides in the table. Once the snapshot of the whole table is completed, it would start streaming the changes that would be made to the table. <br/>

  Note that the snapshot feature uses a GFlag cdc_snapshot_batch size, the default value for which is 250 i.e. the number of records that would be there in one batch when an internal call would be placed to get the snapshot, so if the table consists of a huge amount of data, you might need to change this value otherwise the streaming of the complete snapshot would take some time.

### GFlags affecting Change Data Capture

### Running the Debezium connector
  
  Head over to the [Debezium connector](https://github.com/vaibhav-yb/CDCDocuments/blob/main/running_cdc_with_debezium.md) doc for the steps on how to run with Debezium connector.
  
### Limitations
  * YCQL tables are not supported currently - [GitHub #11320](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/11320)
  * DROP and TRUNCATE commands are not supported. If a user tries to issue these commands on a table while a stream ID is there for the table, the server might crash, the behaviour is unstable - TRUNCATE [GitHub #10010](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10010) / DROP [GitHub #10069](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10069)
  * If a stream ID is created, and after that a new table is created, then the existing stream ID would not be able to stream data from the newly created table, the user would need to create a new stream ID. - [GitHub #10921](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10921)
  * A single stream cannot be used to stream data for both YSQL and YCQL namespaces and keyspaces respectively - [GitHub #10131](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10131) <br/><br/>

  Apart from the above mentioned ones, Change Data Capture would not work alongside the following features, the support will be added in the upcoming releases:
  * Tablet splitting - [GitHub #10935](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10935)
  * Point In Time Recovery (PITR) - [GitHub #10938](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10938)
  * Savepoints - [GitHub #10936](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10936)
